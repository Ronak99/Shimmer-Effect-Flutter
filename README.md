Shimmer Effect is really cool placeholder effect that you can show when you are loading data in the form of a list. To do it in flutter we use the dependency called Shimmer. After trying it out I realized that it can be used for much more than just simple placeholder. It can be used to even represent your brand or some icon, you can also give get some fancy effects by playing with different combinations of colors.

See the video where I explain more about the project [here](https://youtu.be/EVO5958KU8o).
